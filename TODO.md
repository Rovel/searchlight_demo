# TODO 

- add an "in print" column, with yes/no/either select and default of "either"
- Add examples of:
  - search without searchlight (plain form / params, setting default)
  - search with ransack (and others?)
  - searchlight + sequel
  - searchlight in mounted Sinatra and Roda apps (new adapters needed?)
