# TODO 

- Add examples of:
  - searchlight + sequel
  - searchlight in mounted Sinatra and Roda apps (new adapters needed?)
  - search with ransack (and others?)

- Add a multi-select (category?)
- See if remaining SL helpers needed
  - is checked? needed? Do "enough" databases understand form booleans?
  - instead of filled?, can we just have blank? that matches ActiveSupport behavior? Less to explain
